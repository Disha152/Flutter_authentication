# koko_authetication

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Flutter application that provides authentication functionality for users. The app uses Firebase Authentication, a third-party service offered by Google, to handle user authentication.

The project includes multiple screens, including a sign-in page, sign-up page, and a home page. The sign-in and sign-up pages allow users to enter their email address and password to create a new account or log in to an existing one. The home page displays a welcome message and a button to log out.

The codebase also includes various Flutter widgets and libraries to implement UI components and handle user interactions with animated headers.

Overall, this project appears to be a basic authentication app built using Flutter and Firebase Authentication. It could serve as a starting point for developers looking to build similar functionality in their own Flutter projects.
