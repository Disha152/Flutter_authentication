# koko_authetication

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Flutter application that provides authentication functionality for users. The app uses Firebase Authentication, a third-party service offered by Google, to handle user authentication.

The project includes multiple screens, including a sign-in page, sign-up page, and a home page. The sign-in and sign-up pages allow users to enter their email address and password to create a new account or log in to an existing one. The home page displays a welcome message and a button to log out.

The codebase also includes various Flutter widgets and libraries to implement UI components and handle user interactions. The project uses the Provider package for state management and dependency injection.

Overall, this project appears to be a basic authentication app built using Flutter and Firebase Authentication. It could serve as a starting point for developers looking to build similar functionality in their own Flutter projects.
